# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Overview:
Amazon Vine is a service that allows publishers and manufacturers to get reviews of their products. The purpose of this analysis was to work with Jennifer of SellBy to analyze reviews by paid members of the Amazon Vine program. SellBy gets paid to publish Amazon Vine reviews. In this project I utilized Amazon Web Service, Google Colaboratory and Postgresql.
