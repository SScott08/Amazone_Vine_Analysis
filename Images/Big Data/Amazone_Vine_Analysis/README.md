# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Overview:
Amazon Vine is a service that allows publishers and manufacturers to get reviews of their products. The purpose of this analysis was to work with Jennifer of SellBy to analyze reviews by paid members of the Amazon Vine program. SellBy gets paid to publish Amazon Vine reviews. In this project I utilized Amazon Web Service, Google Colaboratory and PgAdmin4.
This analysis was performed on a video game product.

Results:

•	The dataset contained 1094 reviews that included: Review ID, star rating, helpful votes, Vine(member) and verified purchase. 
•	There were 94 Vine reviews, 48 of the reviews were five star. That is 51% of the reviews being five star.
•	There were 1000 Non- Vine reviews, 38 of the reviews were five star. That is 26% of the reviews being five star.
Summary
When comparing the Vine member reviews to the Non Vine member reviews there may be a bias to the reviews. With a higher percentage of five star reviews it id obvious that the incentive to give a better review exists.
